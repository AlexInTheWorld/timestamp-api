# Backend Challenges - APIs and Microservices Projects (FCC):

## Welcome to Timestamp MicroService, my first API project


The project is based on FCC's analogous app [Timestamp Microservice](https://curse-arrow.glitch.me/).

### My Project

It is a simple app that converts dates with the format `yyyy/mm/dd` to a utc and unix format and
returns them contained in a JSON.
